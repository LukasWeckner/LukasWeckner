From april 2023 till mid july 2023 I attended a 12 week full time web development bootcamp. During the first 8 weeks we got to know about various different technologies used in modern web development. For each topic we completed several coding challenges.
<br/>
<br/>
The following topics were part of the bootcamp:
- React.js, Next.js
- Git, Github, Npm
- HTML5, CSS, Javascript
- REST API, MongoDB, Mongoose
- Jest, React Testing Library
- Pair programming, Scrum, Kanban

## Final Project
During the last 4 weeks of the course we build our own web app.
