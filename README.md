# Hello and welcome to my new depository
<br />

## About me:
My name is Lukas and I'm an aspiring frontend developer. Right now I'm taking part in a web development bootcamp. This is my first excercise to become more familiar with github as a version control tool.

## Things I like about the bootcamp:
1. Meeting and getting to know new people 👫
2. Keep learning and improving 📚
3. Having a fixed schedule ⏰
